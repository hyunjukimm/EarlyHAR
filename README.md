# EarlyHAR

Early Human Activity Recognition (EarlyHAR) is critical for time-sensitive applications, yet existing approaches often struggle with complex real-world activities due to fixed label spaces and heuristic stopping strategies. In this work, we reformulate EarlyHAR as a problem of dynamic search space optimization under partial observation and identify two fundamental failure modes in existing Early Time Series Classification pipelines: (1) early-stage ambiguity arising from an unstructured hypothesis space, and (2) progression-inconsistent commitment caused by premature collapse of the search space. To address these challenges, we propose DEAR (Dynamic Search Space for Early Activity Recognition), a unified framework that explicitly manages evolving activity hypotheses over time. DEAR stabilizes early decisions through knowledge-enhanced disambiguation that injects semantic contextual priors, and enforces progression-consistent recognition via structured chain-of-reasoning over dynamically refined class candidates. An uncertainty-aware stopping mechanism further ensures timely yet stable halting under partial observations. We evaluate DEAR on five real-world HAR datasets spanning wearable and ambient sensing environments. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods in the accuracy-timeliness trade-off, decision stability, and robustness under challenging partial observations.
